ilikepizza107 — Yesterday at 11:03 PM

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:05 PM
Nah bro windy said some choice things ab us but we resolved it
He said sorry and that was chill but walbats in this bitch taking cyber off servers trying to blame him for leaking shit

aquarius | non vampire | FROGS!! — Yesterday at 11:05 PM

Damage — Yesterday at 11:05 PM

Shrug — Yesterday at 11:05 PM
All for things being resolved. 🙌

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:05 PM
I resolved with windy.
Take an ounce of accountability cuz wow that’s so wacky your mad at someone sharing shitty things going on in other discord’s

Shrug — Yesterday at 11:07 PM
Ah, sounds like some not great stuff for sure. 

ilikepizza107 — Yesterday at 11:08 PM
Huh, didn’t see any of that

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:08 PM
They make their own discord

Damage — Yesterday at 11:08 PM
Na shrug just clearly lines in this discord where other feel they can say whatever they want about others
Not healthy

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:08 PM
To say some really really shitty things ab people
But if you call them out they will scape goat the person who leaked it
Isn’t that a healthy thing for the scene

ilikepizza107 — Yesterday at 11:09 PM
Oh wow

aquarius | non vampire | FROGS!! — Yesterday at 11:11 PM

Joker’s Greatest Trick 👻 — Yesterday at 11:24 PM
Yeah
[11:24 PM]
Like how is anyone’s image going to be shot if this is a private matter

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:24 PM
Cuz they kicked cyber for leaking it

shapes333 — Yesterday at 11:24 PM
The coelacanth is strong but the mud patrol is stronger

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:24 PM
We don’t know who kicked we just know it’s one of the dudes who didn’t say shit to defend us

13usen13 — Yesterday at 11:24 PM
I kicked cyber

Joker’s Greatest Trick 👻 — Yesterday at 11:25 PM
80% of the people here have no clue what you’re talking about, so if this just didn’t get brought up no ones “image” would be impacted at all

Damage — Yesterday at 11:25 PM
Idk grant like how could ur image not take a hit from having that said in ur discord and kicking the person who allowed to be known

shapes333 — Yesterday at 11:25 PM
That's my butt

You’d prefer that saying white suprematist stay hidden?
[11:25 PM]
It’s a public chat grant

13usen13 — Yesterday at 11:25 PM
My server isnt?
[11:25 PM]
You cant get into it
[11:25 PM]
Lol

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:25 PM
So I kicked him for telling us that what he said was fucked up?

Damage — Yesterday at 11:25 PM
Not fucking dms it’s a discord with “30” people

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:25 PM
And shouldn’t be said

aquarius | non vampire | FROGS!! — Yesterday at 11:26 PM
??????

13usen13 — Yesterday at 11:26 PM
Its a college group lol

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:26 PM
Even windy acknowledged he shouldn’t say that shit because it’s extremely fucked up to talk ab people in that way

13usen13 — Yesterday at 11:26 PM
Andrew is the one who said white supremacist and he answered for it

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:26 PM
And ur defending that and trying to hide that

13usen13 — Yesterday at 11:26 PM
I dont get what you guys want lol

aquarius | non vampire | FROGS!! — Yesterday at 11:26 PM

Damage — Yesterday at 11:26 PM
That basically indicates you’ll do it more

13usen13 — Yesterday at 11:27 PM
Do you want anything other than to fling turds all night

Shrug — Yesterday at 11:27 PM
At the risk of getting mired in this, it doesn't seem like mcnerd and Damage are contending the group was created with the intention of shittalking them but rather that shittalk about them has happened there. From what I'm gathering Cyber was added to that server, saw an instance of that talk, told Durick and Spencer, and then got kicked for it. I'd say talking bad about people behind their backs isn't a good thing, and it can result in bad feelings getting cultivated between different sub-groups of a larger group.

aquarius | non vampire | FROGS!! — Yesterday at 11:27 PM

Mista Lova Lova — Yesterday at 11:27 PM
Idk why u were kicked johnny and I tried to keep this private but the cats out of the bag and the point still stands what happened was very shitty

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:27 PM
That is a good summary shrug and I do appreciate it

13usen13 — Yesterday at 11:27 PM
Johnny wasnt kicked

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:28 PM
Cuz we are kind of everywhere just because angry

Mista Lova Lova — Yesterday at 11:28 PM
From other server

@13usen13
Johnny wasnt kicked

aquarius | non vampire | FROGS!! — Yesterday at 11:28 PM
kicked from other one

13usen13 — Yesterday at 11:28 PM
Yea now if you can like

Damage — Yesterday at 11:28 PM
Shrug that was well written

13usen13 — Yesterday at 11:28 PM
Tell me what you want from me instead of just raging in a chat for 3 more fucking hours

RobbyRabs — Yesterday at 11:28 PM
Thank you shrug very cool

13usen13 — Yesterday at 11:28 PM

Juri (Windy) — Yesterday at 11:36 PM
I had every right to be held accountable. And my actions have negatively impacted both discords.

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:36 PM
Raymond we could not know who did this. We just wanted to understand how it happened. Matter and I are talking but people are allowed to be upset.

shapes333 — Yesterday at 11:37 PM
Bro

Joker’s Greatest Trick 👻 — Yesterday at 11:38 PM
Well that’s fine I think people can be mad
But like

Juri (Windy) — Yesterday at 11:38 PM
I think probably the better course of action may have been to have a discussion with Cyber instead of kicking him

Joker’s Greatest Trick 👻 — Yesterday at 11:38 PM
I don’t know why it has to involve everyone who is on this discord now

Juri (Windy) — Yesterday at 11:38 PM
No, in a way it does
I'm an ancient and kinda influential person and should have known better

RobbyRabs — Yesterday at 11:39 PM
I think it’s fair for people to see that people are okay to hide vile and possibly damaging things behind peoples backs, it’s just crazy to see that people are fine openly saying they hide the bad things they say

Joker’s Greatest Trick 👻 — Yesterday at 11:39 PM
Cuz now everybody knows and now peoples opinions are definitely going to be changed as a result

Juri (Windy) — Yesterday at 11:39 PM
Not known better, because I did. Done better I mean

13usen13 — Yesterday at 11:39 PM
Andrew did get made mod after this so i think the worry of what went on the night we bitched about drama in there is fair
But ive said multiple times the discord isnt like some secret smash trash talk discord

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:40 PM
No one cares ab u bitching ab drama

Mista Lova Lova — Yesterday at 11:40 PM
I didn't show those either

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:40 PM
Dude call people a load of other insults

13usen13 — Yesterday at 11:40 PM
Its existed for longer than this discord has

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:40 PM
Don’t make random comments ab their character

Damage — Yesterday at 11:40 PM
Busen no one cares at all how long the discord has existed

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:40 PM
I would never call u something like that without backing

RobbyRabs — Yesterday at 11:40 PM
That’s kinda the point Raymond, I think it’s fair for people to see that stuff is being said behind their backs and some people are going out of there way to cover it up

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:40 PM
We r allowed to take issue with something so drastic

aquarius | non vampire | FROGS!! — Yesterday at 11:40 PM
bruh youre bringing up stuff from other discord
for no reason

Juri (Windy) — Yesterday at 11:41 PM
There's not no reason.

Damage — Yesterday at 11:41 PM
No ones is reading windy comments I guess

Juri (Windy) — Yesterday at 11:41 PM
My mistake needs owning up to honestly

Damage — Yesterday at 11:41 PM
Literally explained why it should be brought up

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:41 PM
Windy ur chillin btw were just mad anyone tried to cover it up

RobbyRabs — Yesterday at 11:41 PM
You a real one windy

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:41 PM
Like me and Spencer both made peace with windy

"Anti" Matter — Yesterday at 11:42 PM
idk who covered it up so to speak

Damage — Yesterday at 11:42 PM
Ask ur boy walbats

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:42 PM
Busen said he kicked cyber
Right?

Damage — Yesterday at 11:42 PM
Don’t know how else to interpret that aspect of it

aquarius | non vampire | FROGS!! — Yesterday at 11:42 PM
youre still in this discord
so whyyy

13usen13 — Yesterday at 11:42 PM
Cyber saw all of it so what are we covering up
We havent talked about it since lol

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:43 PM
Kicking him is just a shitty way of not taking accountability. You are just mad he saw it

aquarius | non vampire | FROGS!! — Yesterday at 11:43 PM

13usen13 — Yesterday at 11:43 PM
Its a private discord and i dont like people sharing what is said in confidentiality

aquarius | non vampire | FROGS!! — Yesterday at 11:44 PM
youre bring stuff from otehr server
to here
for no reason

RobbyRabs — Yesterday at 11:44 PM
Even if said things are a direct attack on someone’s character?

13usen13 — Yesterday at 11:44 PM
Assumably anyone in there could bitch about anyone outside of there as would be the same in a private in person conversation

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:44 PM
Not bitching

Damage — Yesterday at 11:44 PM
Grant ur like a bot dude

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:44 PM
As I said throw insults no one cares
Don’t say serious claims like that

Damage — Yesterday at 11:44 PM
I can’t hear the same shitty as justification

aquarius | non vampire | FROGS!! — Yesterday at 11:45 PM
LOLLLL

This is just a server to play smash bros though?? Like we aren’t some big government corporation trying to do “cover ups” or ruin someone’s “image” we literally just play video games for fun why does this has to be this whole thing

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:46 PM
People can absolve things Raymond lmao

Damage — Yesterday at 11:46 PM
shit I mean guess ur right Busen I’m a white supremest like the fact that y’all are absolutely ignoring windys resolve over this is insane

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:46 PM
Also we tried to dm

RobbyRabs — Yesterday at 11:46 PM
People’s images are being attacked and people deserve to know these things

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:46 PM
At one point we no longer knew who was doing things

aquarius | non vampire | FROGS!! — Yesterday at 11:46 PM

RobbyRabs — Yesterday at 11:47 PM

13usen13 — Yesterday at 11:47 PM
I literally said i kicked cyber what more accountability do you want WHAT DO YOU WANT LOL

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:47 PM
Nah man we expect apologies if ur taking people out for saying bad shit like that lmao

Juri (Windy) — Yesterday at 11:47 PM
He did admit I was correct about how kicking cyber that way wasn't the best way to approach it

aquarius | non vampire | FROGS!! — Yesterday at 11:48 PM

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:48 PM
Spencer and I?

aquarius | non vampire | FROGS!! — Yesterday at 11:48 PM

why would you bring it up in here
for no reason

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:48 PM
We didn’t know who did it?

This is the only place we could figure that out lmao we said that a few times

Damage — Yesterday at 11:48 PM
Johnny windy has literally said it’s fair to bring it up here

Juri (Windy) — Yesterday at 11:49 PM
I mean

aquarius | non vampire | FROGS!! — Yesterday at 11:49 PM
theres like 50 other people in the general

Juri (Windy) — Yesterday at 11:49 PM
Maybe not in general

Anime sword boy — Yesterday at 11:49 PM
Windy has said it has a reason to be brought up here, idk if that applies but that's what I'm seeing from scanning

aquarius | non vampire | FROGS!! — Yesterday at 11:49 PM
who use it for other things

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:49 PM
We had no way of knowing Busen was the one who wanted to cover future shit up and we wanted to know why he would do something like that

aquarius | non vampire | FROGS!! — Yesterday at 11:49 PM
so why
would you post it here

Juri (Windy) — Yesterday at 11:49 PM
I think it would be useful to have kinda a conflict channel

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:49 PM
Conflict channel vote

Juri (Windy) — Yesterday at 11:49 PM
But it is something that needed to be brought up

aquarius | non vampire | FROGS!! — Yesterday at 11:49 PM
theres nothing to cover up if you said its resolved
thats the issue

13usen13 — Yesterday at 11:50 PM
Future shit i dont think about you

I was playjng guilty gear until i got multipe dms telling me about this shit show

Juri (Windy) — Yesterday at 11:50 PM
Something where only parties involved can chat with a mediator. But it's read only still to others? I dunno if that's a thing.

13usen13 — Yesterday at 11:50 PM
Im running some fucking shadow cabal controlling the smash discord lol

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:50 PM
Lmao you can be our therapist windy

Anime sword boy — Yesterday at 11:51 PM
You can set up permissions like that yeah

RobbyRabs — Yesterday at 11:51 PM
Okay it could be anyone who could have their character attacked tho, the point is you’re trying to cover for shitty behavior man

aquarius | non vampire | FROGS!! — Yesterday at 11:51 PM

mcnerd16 — Yesterday at 11:51 PM

aquarius | non vampire | FROGS!! — Yesterday at 11:53 PM
????? when was I doing that
im just using that as example

Juri (Windy) — Yesterday at 11:54 PM
I think overall Grant did admit what he did was wrong. But I think he feels like he doesn't know what to say or do because it's kinda situation without a solution?

shapes333 — Yesterday at 11:55 PM
Yo like who cares what another person thinks you? Like we adults? Live ya life
